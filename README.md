# Kraken
This project is an attempt to introduce my son to world of programming.

This is a video game he's conceived which I will try to implement 
with him beside me, hopefully giving him some stuff to do so he can
learn how these things are made.

# The Game
In the game, you play a Kraken with up to 8 tentacles and your goal is 
to smash increasingly more difficult pirate ships (starting with row boats
and increasing in difficulty to ships of the line with cannons that shoot 
back). You can hit things with your tentacles, or you can wrap your
tentacles around ships.

It will be written in C# and Godot.
